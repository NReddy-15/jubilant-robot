CIS1051 - Spring 2023 - Final Project

Here is the link to my project video: https://youtu.be/6wrXwA7roAk

I really enjoyed making this project, although I did not get to finish all of the writing or art. I did not realize how long it would take to write
the kind of story I wanted, and I did lose some steam towards the end, but overall, I am proud of the product I have. I was able to learn about
the Ren'Py program and how to use it.

One of the challenges I encountered was how to assign certain boolean values and implement those into what options are available for the player. This was something very new that was not included in the demo story that came with the program. However, after reading some documentation and experimenting a bit, I was able to figure it out.

I also honestly wish I could've made the story a little more engaging, but maybe that is a task for another time
if I want to flesh out this project on my own time. Adding music and sound effects would really enhance the experience, and that could be something
to look into. Overall, I really liked being able to try and partake in a medium that I have enjoyed before!

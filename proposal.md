## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A visual novel about a girl who finds a secret room in a local library and the company of a book-loving ghost. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will allow the player to play a visual novel with a story that I am writing. The visual novel will also contain original art and music. It will be executed using the Ren'py software.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A complete visual novel with a clear story and decent art.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The complete visual novel has more side scenes and options to gain more information about what it happening. All art is of decent quality. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The visual novel has its complete, intended story. All music and art is complete and is of better than decent quality. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn more about using Ren'py and how to implement all of the features that I want. This will include where to place different assets and files, as well as the syntax for coding in Ren'py. I know that my Python knowledge can be used, so I need to learn how it can be implemented. Although I have more experience will digital art and music, I will also need to learn the formats of these needed to use them in Ren'py.
